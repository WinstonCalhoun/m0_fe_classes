# Self Evaluation

- This final CFU encompassed everything you've learned in Mod 0, and maybe even required some learning outside of what you've explicitly been taught. How did it feel as you faced these challenges?
// More difficult that i remember.  Most parts were easier until the end where it is stuff less practiced.
- How is your workflow going, in terms of taking breaks, staying focused, etc.?
// Workflow is going well.  Taking correct amount of breaks to be able to come back and stay focused for set amoun of time.
- What do you need to do to be ready for intense technical lessons and challenges like this, for 6 hours/day next week? What support do you need?
// Seems like a regular job.  Every 2 hours a 10 minute.
